	<p>Bluesoft Design is an all in one web design agency based 
	in South Plainfield, New Jersey. From start to finish, we
	take care of it all. It all started with our founder, 
	David, who had been designing and creating websites since his
	sophomore year in high school. Once high school was finished,
	David went on to study web design and java development at Rutgers University,
	all while continuing to build websites as a freelancer and honing his skills. 
	When David graduated with his Bachelors Degree in Information Technology, 
	he decided to invest in creating a web design & digital marketing agency 
	and grew Bluesoft Design into the established and well-loved business it is today.</p>
	<p>Today, Bluesoft Design is a leader in the web design & digital marketing field 
	with a flawless reputation all across the board. It is because 
	of David’s dedication to hard work and doing things the right way
	rather than the easy way that we have tons of happy clients with beautiful
	websites and growing online reputations.The rogue nation claims that it conducted
	a successful test of a new hypersonic vehicle on Wednesday (Jan. 5),
	its second such trial in just over three months. 
	The vehicle aced a 75-mile (120 kilometers) lateral maneuver and
	"precisely hit" a target 435 miles (700 km) from the launch site, 
	according to a statement</p>
